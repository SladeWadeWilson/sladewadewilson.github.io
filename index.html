JONATHAN'S, "NO CODE," BLOG.
=========================================================================================

Hi.  I'm Jonathan.  I used to make sites using HTML with a bit of JavaScript and CSS I copied
from the internet, but I thought, why don't make a new blog that would be as fast and simple as possible.
By fast andsimple, I mean you better use the zoom function in your browser here, because this site has
absolutely no code.  That's right, it's just like a text file, but is an html document instead.  And I'm
going to use it as a blog.

So, with a blog, I need to find something to talk about.  What should I talk about today? Hrrm......

I guess current events would be a good thing to start with.  You know how Trumpo became President
last year and everyone was freaking out?  Yeah, I don't care, but I do talk about him jokingly a
lot.  My cousin even called me a bit obsessed.

Anyways, I have an appointment for calling a friend, so hopefully next time, readers!  (If there actual will
be any.)

4/14/17 - Second post of the day:

Sorry if that last one was a bit rushed.  I think this one might be a bit too.  I guess I'm a little on-edge.

So, I started reading this book called, "Forbidden Animation."  Naturally, it's about the history of
censorship in, well, animation.  I'm a strong believe in preserving the, "original," versions of movies.
Any time I can, I try to download as many of them as I can.  Screw Hollywood revisionism.

Like, even something as small as Alderaan being in the position it was in the4 Blu-Ray, (as opposed to
the not-correctly-centered position it was already,) on the Despecialized Edition bothers me.  When
I read a book like, "George Lucas: A Life," by Brian Jay Jones, and see how they talk about how
a human, (who is, by nature, imperfect,) had to literally hold up Alderaan the whole time, I feel
\like it erases a part of history.  The Despecialized Editions did a good job of removing Lucas'
attacks on history, though.

I once had a bit of an interest in Levantine history in particular.  I would spend weeks
trying to figure out whether or not Sargon of Akkad was, in fact, the Biblical Nimrod, or
someone else.  I also found the history of the Phoenicians interesting.  How Hebrew
and Phoenician were grouped together in the, "Canaanite languages."  I even downloaded
off YouTube a piece of the script from the Ancient Roman play, "Poenulus," which
contqains a bit of Phoenician's descendant language, Punic, (as Carthaginians, who are
featured in the play, were descendnats of Phoenican colonists,) in addition to Latin.

Anyways, i really got6ta go.  So, bye!
