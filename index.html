JONATHAN'S, "NO CODE," BLOG.
=========================================================================================

Hi.  I'm Jonathan.  I used to make sites using HTML with a bit of JavaScript and CSS I copied
from the internet, but I thought, why don't make a new blog that would be as fast and simple as possible.
By fast andsimple, I mean you better use the zoom function in your browser here, because this site has
absolutely no code.  That's right, it's just like a text file, but is an html document instead.  And I'm
going to use it as a blog.

So, with a blog, I need to find something to talk about.  What should I talk about today? Hrrm......

I guess current events would be a good thing to start with.  You know how Trumpo became President
last year and everyone was freaking out?  Yeah, I don't care, but I do talk about him jokingly a
lot.  My cousin even called me a bit obsessed.

Anyways, I have an appointment for calling a friend, so hopefully next time, readers!  (If there actual will
be any.)
