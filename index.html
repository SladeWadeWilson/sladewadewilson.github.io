JONATHAN'S, "NO CODE," BLOG.
=========================================================================================

Hi.  I'm Jonathan.  I used to make sites using HTML with a bit of JavaScript and CSS I copied
from the internet, but I thought, why don't I make a new blog that would be as fast and simple as possible?
By fast and simple, what I mean is you better use the zoom function in your browser here, because this site has
absolutely no code.  That's right, it's just like a text file, but is an html document instead.  And I'm
going to use it as a blog.

So, with a blog, I need to find something to talk about.  What should I talk about today? Hrrm......

I guess current events would be a good thing to start with.  You know how Trumpo became President
last year and everyone was freaking out?  Yeah, I don't care, but I do talk about him jokingly a
lot.  My cousin even called me a bit obsessed.

Anyways, I have an appointment for calling a friend, so hopefully next time, readers!  (If there actual will
be any.)

4/14/17 - Second post of the day:

Sorry if that last one was a bit rushed.  I think this one might be a bit too.  I guess I'm a little on-edge.

So, I started reading this book called, "Forbidden Animation."  Naturally, it's about the history of
censorship in, well, animation.  I'm a strong believe in preserving the, "original," versions of movies.
Any time I can, I try to download as many of them as I can.  Screw Hollywood revisionism.

Like, even something as small as Alderaan being in the position it was in the Blu-Ray, (as opposed to
the not-correctly-centered position it was originally,) on the Despecialized Edition bothers me.  When
I read a book like, "George Lucas: A Life," by Brian Jay Jones, and see how they talk about how
a human, (who is, by nature, imperfect,) had to literally hold up Alderaan the whole time, I feel
like it erases a part of history.  The Despecialized Editions did a good job of removing most of Lucas'
attacks on history, though.

I once had a bit of an interest in Levantine history in particular.  I would spend weeks
trying to figure out whether or not Sargon of Akkad was, in fact, the Biblical Nimrod, or
someone else.  I also found the history of the Phoenicians interesting, such as how Hebrew
and Phoenician were grouped together in the, "Canaanite languages."  I even downloaded
off YouTube a piece of the script from the Ancient Roman play, "Poenulus," which
contains a bit of Phoenician's descendant language, Punic, (as Carthaginians, who are
featured in the play, were descendants of Phoenican colonists,) in addition to Latin.

Anyways, i really gotta go.  So, bye!

Hello there!  I thought I'd give my take on The Last Jedi trailer, which I saw yesterday.
Like people had been worrying about, it does copy a lot from Empire, in particular the Jedi training
sequences.  But they even went so far as to put the AT-ATs on an ice planet again!  Well, I guess it
makes more sense than the jungle planet they were in Rogue One, but, that's not my point.  I really
hope they don't just copy the OG trilogy with each movie.  It would be ridiculous.

Today I ordered an Avegant Glyph.  It's like a virtual reality headset, except instead of strapping
a screen onto your face, it projects the image onto a million mirrors and then back onto your eyeballs.
I hope I don't go blind, G-D Forbid!  What's cool though is it's compatible with any device that
you can plug an HDMI cable into.  The first thing I'm using it for is Wii Sports on my Wii U.
I'll probably also use it to watch my laptop's movie collection and even download some free VR games on Steam.
I hope it's all it's cracked up to be!

Anyways, hope y'all have a good week! -Jon.
